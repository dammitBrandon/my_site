                My journey began April 8<sup>th</sup>, 1987 in Washington, D.C. but for the sake of brevity I will start with one particular formative experience;
                amongst many, which started me on this lifelong journey in technology.  One day in the late 90â€™s on one of our many trips to the bookstore
                my mother and I would take, I convinced my mother to purchase me an A+ Certification for Dummies book.  With the knowledge from this book
                and the household computer, a Compaq Presario EZ2200 Desktop, my curiosity, time and a Phillips screwdriver I disassembled this machine to
                learn the internals of this engineering achievement that is so ubiquitous it is often taken for granted.  This was the beginning of my
                journey to unravel the manifold of systems that make up this complex tool that many of us have come to be inseparable from.

            <p>
                Fast forward to senior year in High School, I made the decision to study Computer Engineering at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University.
                I will never forget the unveiling of the additional layers of complexity that computers had; the softer side of things if you will, with my Introduction
                to Programming course.  This along with other courses I studied and learned to gain an appreciation of the hardware, underlying drivers, operating systems
                and end user applications that people use and depend on everyday.  During my studies I interned and would later start my career at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).
                After two years and some truly formative experiences with the people I met and projects that I was a part of I solidified my commitment and resolve to keep
                developing my skillset.  My passion and desire to grow and develop could not be contained; so I decided to be part of a very small group of brave trail blazers
                and enrolled in an experimental and new approach to learning web development: Dev Boot Camp Chicago (DBC).  The program had just opened its doors and this was a huge
                risk, which many of my family and mentors advised against, encouraging me to stay with my current path in Washington, D.C. area.  However this was a decision I knew I
                could not turn down and made the leap of faith to move to Chicago, IL to develop further as a Software Engineer.  The experiences I had at DBC were exactly what I needed
                to push me both as a person and as a developer.  The program provided me with a place to focus fully on the pursuit of web and application development whilst meeting some
                truly amazing and inspiring individuals.  I truly feel the relationships that I developed and still maintain are much more valuable than any technical skillset.
            </p>
            <p>
                After DBC I would take my first role as a Software Engineer at Slalom Consulting.  I have been working at Slalom for a little over three years and have continued
                to develop as an engineer, learning as much as I can about Software Craftsmanship and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), as well as learning industry best
                practices and most importantly I continued to learn and develop myself as a human being.  One thing that truly stuck with me during my time at Slalom are the individuals
                who had taken an interest in me and provided me with guidance and mentorship on my journey, whom I am truly grateful for.
            </p>
            <p>
                These experiences have continued to inspire me and fueled the unceasing desire to help and inspire others, affording them the same guidance encouragement, support and
                mentorship I was afforded.  I started two initiatives within our organization and as a co-lead of one of our Employee Resource Groups (ERG), developed relationships
                with Citizen Schools and Spark Program.  With these two programs we focused on providing these young malleable minds from Southside Chicago neighborhoods with an
                invaluable introduction and experience with technology and business consulting.  Our ultimate goal is to spark their interest in STEM fields and provide them the
                courage to pursue these fields through their High School and collegiate careers, not to mention exposing them to our great workspace in the Greater Downtown Chicago area.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I often reflect, I am grateful for what my past and current experiences have afforded me to deepen my skillsets and am thrilled for what is still in store for me on my
                journey led by faith, fueled by an incessant curiosity of the unknown and passion for technology and helping others.
